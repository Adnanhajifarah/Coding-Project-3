1. Basic Calculator
a. First ask the user to enter two numbers.
b. Then show them a menu of options:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Divide
4. Multiplication
c. Depending on the option they pick (1-4) your program should
display the correct output

2. Minimum/Maximum
a. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers. The
program should use the conditional operator to determine which
number is the smaller and which is the larger.
Example Output: “10 is the smaller number. 13 is the bigger number.”

3. Areas of a Rectangle
a. Write a program that asks for the length and width of two

the secondary color that results by mixing two primary colors.

5. Geometry Calculator
a. Write a program that displays the following menu:
Geometry Calculator
1. Calculate the Area of a circle
2. Calculate the Area of a rectangle
3. Calculate the Area of a triangle
4. Quit
Enter your choice (1-4)
Depending on the user's choice, the program should ask for the relevant
